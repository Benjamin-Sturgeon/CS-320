Hello,

This course provided an overview of basic testing methods used in software testing. 

    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I am able to ensure this by completing thorough testing of improper function and security vulnerabilites. Testing improper function is first done at the unit level via tests such as Junit tests. These test the function of code often by attempting to use the code with incorrect data or outside of the correct context. Ensuring that there is code which catches and reports this incorrect function is critically important to a successful program. Automated tests can also be used which can test the software for security vulnerabilites or many use cases at once. 

    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I am able to interpret user needs by conducting interviews with the potential user base or its representation and then creating thorough documentation. Documentation is important in order to cleary designate the use-cases of the program so that developers are aware of what the program is intended to do. In methods like Agile, users are a part of the entire development process by providing input and reactions at each stage of development. 

    How do I approach designing software?

This course primarly used the Test Driven Development approach to designing software, although there are other methods such as those that are focusing on program behavior or integration. Test Driven development designates tests at every stage of development with a goal of at least 80% coverage of the code and its uses. This provides direct, unbiased feedback on program functionality and security. 

I have also attached the Contact classes which were tested in this course using Junit tests in the form of csv sources and parameterized tests.
